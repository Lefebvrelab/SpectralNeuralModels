# Spectral Neural Models 

This repository contains notes and code relating to spectral- (i.e. frequency) domain models of macro-scale neural dynamics. 

The primary focus of this type of neurophysiological model is to reproduce two key features of the M/EEG power spectrum: 

i) Spectral peaks (alpha, theta, etc.); number, location, magnitude

ii) Power law scaling ($1/f$, $1/f^x$, etc.)


## Robinson Model

## Wilson-Cowan
